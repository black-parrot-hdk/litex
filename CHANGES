[> 2020.04, released April 28th, 2020
-------------------------------------

	[> Description
	--------------
	First release of LiteX and the ecosystem of cores!

	LiteX is a Migen/MiSoC based Core/SoC builder that provides the infrastructure to easily create
	Cores/SoCs (with or without CPU).

	The common components of a SoC are provided directly:
	- Buses and Streams (Wishbone, AXI, Avalon-ST)
	- Interconnect
	- Common cores (RAM, ROM, Timer, UART, etc...)
	- CPU wrappers/integration
	- etc...
	And SoC creation capabilities can be greatly extended with the ecosystem of LiteX cores (DRAM,
	PCIe, Ethernet, SATA, etc...) that can be integrated/simulated/build easily with LiteX.

	It also provides build backends for open-source and vendors toolchains.
